# Go Tutorial (Personal)

This repo is my personal space for learning and experimenting with Go.

Each folder is a separate Go module with its own `go.mod` file, so I can explore different concepts in isolation.

## Structure
## Running a tutorial

```bash
cd lesson-xx-example
go run .
```

## Updates
At the time of writing I am really just going through the docs on go.dev/doc/tutorial.
